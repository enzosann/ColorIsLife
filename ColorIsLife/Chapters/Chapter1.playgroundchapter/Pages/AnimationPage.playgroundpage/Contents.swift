 # ACT Time!
 
 Quarks, Gluons, Color charge, anti-color charge and strong strength. These are the keywords we have met in the previous pages.
 Now with a few simple commands I will let you participate in the life of quarks and gluons.
 You can choose a quark and change its color and, consequently, **move the gluons** as you want,
 always trying to **balance** the **charge of color**.
 I am sure you are an expert by now and you will soon be able to rebalance the charges of color.
 
 * Experiment:
 To start our jorney you need to declare these **three** variable as **red, green** and **blue**.
