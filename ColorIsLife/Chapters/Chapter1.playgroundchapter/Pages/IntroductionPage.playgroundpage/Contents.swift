 # Introduction
 
 Once upon a time there were very small elementary particles, practically invisible to the human eye,
 these particles were called **Quarks**. The quarks were really special particles: they had a **color charge**!
 This characteristic made them special and distinguishable from other particles.
 They could be: **Red, Green** and **Blue**.

 There were also the **anti-quarks**, that carried three types of **anti-color**:
 * Cyan
 * Magenta
 * Yellow

 * Experiment:
 To start our jorney you need to declare these **three** **quarks** as **red, green** and **blue**.
