 # Strong Friendship
 
 Quarks weren't the only ones with this characteristic, even some friends of the quarks, called **Gluons**,
 possessed this property. In fact the gluons could even have a **charge of color** or, alternatively, an **anti-color charge**.
 One day it was discovered that the gluons managed to keep the quarks **attached to each other**,
 thanks to their **strong strength**. Also the gluons could feel attracted to the quarks as their distance increased.
 In short, they were **inseparable friends**. Unfortunately sometimes it happens that such strong friendships can end,
 and even quarks and gluons can separate.
 Do you know what quarks do when they quarrel with gluons? They **change their color**.
 And do you know what the gluons do instead? They look for **another quark** to get to know and make them change color.
 
 * Experiment:
 Now I will show you the gluons in the Scene. It's very simple, you just need to set **true** the variable below.
