 # Conclusion
 Summing up in this Playground Book we have read terms such as:
 **Quarks, Gluons, Color Charge, Anti-Color Charge** and **Strong Strength** and we treated them like friends
 who quarrel and change color.
 We have treated the strong force as the will of the gluons to not separate from the quarks
 and the color charge as a way, of the quarks, to externally manifest the fact of having changed state.
 Everything we have talked about so far is actually **Physics**, more precisely **Quantum Physics**.
 Also we have seen, just a little bit, **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**.
 This Playground Book tries to show that with the right words we can **teach children** the subject that are more complicated,
 like Physics, from the first years of their life.
