 # Core Invaders
 Oh no! now things get tough. **Hordes of gluons** are attacking our quark.
 They want to make them change color by **shooting them charges of color**.
 Our hero will not last long, he has been fighting alone for a long time, you are the only one that can save him from this situation.
 * Experiment:
 Here you can set how much **difficult** must to be the game (you need to write a number),
 and you need to call the function to setup the scene, write: **coreInvaders()**  When you are ready **Tap "Run My Code" to start!**
